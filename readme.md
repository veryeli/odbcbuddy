# ODBC buddy

utility i set up once i configured odbc on one system because it's hard to do on each new computer

it should work on the computer you run it on but then you can just hit this url - just keep it secret. this is for a temporary project and i only use it when i need it.

configure via nginx so you can only access from development computer

runs via sudo systemctl restart gunicorn-flask
